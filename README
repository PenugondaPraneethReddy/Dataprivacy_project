Our project, “Anonymising Buyer and Seller data in Online Shopping” aims in achieving the maintenance of privacy and utility preservation of the final anonymized data that we return after a set of algorithms and procedures that we apply on the generated test dataset.
Some of the key techniques and methodologies like tokenization, suppression, recoding, and generalization are used initially to make the foundation of anonymized data stronger and have implemented the K-anonymization algorithm technique of anonymization large datasets using the concepts of data-fly algorithm. Project is implemented in python, as this provides a lot of functionalities that are easy to work on with Comma separated files, the common format in which many of the datasets are stored and used for the analysis by the analysis teams in big companies.
For reporting the whole timeline and conveying the project architecture using diagrams and flowcharts, we have used online tools for the ease of convenience. The reporting of all was made in word and CSV file storing and reading was done using Excel.
